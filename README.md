FA oxidation on [Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_oxidation)
In the words of Wikipedia:
> "Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-coA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are used by the electron transport chain."

NADH 
> In metabolism, NAD+ is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. 

FADH2
>  flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a redox cofactor involved in several important reactions in metabolism.
