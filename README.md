## Cahpter 7 fatty acid synthesis
[Khan Academy on Syntese](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YV0bHzHAfw)
> Fatty acid synthesis starts with the carboxylation of acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA. This irreversible reaction is the committed step in fatty acid synthesis

* The enzyme system that catalyzes the synthesis of saturated long-chain fatty acids from acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA, and NADPH is called the fatty acid synthase
* Fatty acids are synthesized by the repetition of the following reaction sequence: condensation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction.
* The growing fatty acid chain is elongated by the sequential addition of two-carbon units derived from acetyl CoA. The activated donor of twocarbon units in the elongation step is malonyl ACP.(Acyl carrier protein) 
* Fatty acids are synthesized in the cytosol, whereas acetyl CoA is formed from pyruvate in mitochondria. Hence, acetyl CoA must be transferred from mitochondria to the cytosol. *The barrier to acetyl CoA is bypassed by citrate, which carries acetyl groups across the inner mitochondrial membrane*

* **Elongation by the fatty acid synthase complex stops on formation of palmitate (C16). *Further elongation and the insertion of double bonds are carried out by other enzyme systems*.**

FA oxidation on [Wikpedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_oxidation)
In the words of Wikipedia:
> "Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acid molecules are broken down in the mitochondria to generate acetyl-coA, which enters the citric acid cycle, and NADH and FADH2, which are used by the electron transport chain."

NADH 
> In metabolism, NAD+ is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. 

FADH2
>  flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a redox cofactor involved in several important reactions in metabolism.
